|---------------------|-------------|
| **📜 News Feed Aggregation** | Fetches and stores news related to companies like TCS, INFY, etc. |
| **📊 Sentiment Analysis** | Analyzes news sentiment using NLP models and visualizes market sentiment shifts. |
| **💸 FX Rates** | Live exchange rates for USD/INR, EUR/INR, JPY/INR, and CHF/INR using a free API. |
| **📈 Historical Stock Data** | Pulls historical data for companies using the NSE India API. |
| **📉 Real-Time Quotes** | Subscribes to real-time feeds and updates selected tickers dynamically. |
| **📄 PDF Summarizer** | Extracts key summaries from uploaded or ingested financial reports. |
| **🧠 RAG Query Handler** | Accepts free-form queries and returns synthesized insights from indexed sources using FAISS. |
| **📊 Interactive Dashboard** | Built using Streamlit and Plotly for real-time visualizations and CSV downloads. |


## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Ingestion Pipelines** pull real-time data from APIs, RSS feeds, and PDFs.
2. **Processing Modules** clean, analyze, and store data (sentiment, FX rates, stocks).
3. **FAISS-based Indexing** allows semantic search over processed content.
4. **Streamlit UI** provides an easy-to-use dashboard to view, interact, and query all modules.
